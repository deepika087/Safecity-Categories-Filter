# Safecity-Categories-Filter

Inside virtual environment of django create a folder Catgeories and clone the content of newmaster branch in it.
Next, runserver.

Go to 127.0.0.1:8000/getCategories.

typing just 127.0.0.1:8000/ won't give any result because default home page is not set yet.

Now chose the category of your choice and get the result in JSON format.

NOTE: Model layer is not used in this project becuase the data is being retrived from CSV file rather than DB itself. Will be changed later once the script points to DB itself.
